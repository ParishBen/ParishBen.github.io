   -Well I can honestly say a project week has never flown so quickly. I pondered over more than a fair share error messages this project, but that's what debugging is all about. I felt the project truly emphasized & dove into data handling, manipulation, display, & the power of JSON.  Figuring out how data is communicated from front end JS to backend Rails made it all the more rewarding to see everything "come to life".  I had bigger goals of a finished product, but got to remain proud of a functional output at the end of the day.

		 
   -I ended up constructing an application that fetched Brewery data from the opendatasoft API (which I would recommend checking out for a wide number of topics). All in all I think the project can pull from around 1422 Breweries from all across the globe. I structured the site to search by city (going along with a passport theme) & then you are able to click the breweries to show/hide more info on the object. From there you can construct your Brewery Wish List of where you'd like to travel. As of now you can display your wish list to the DOM. 
			
			
   -I fully plan on adding more functionality to the application like deleting & transferring from wish->favorite list amongst other to-dos. I'd really like to orchestrate CRD for both a wish list & favorited list. All in all though it was great to try out different methods to 'grab' the right elements & objects and hone some object-oriented coding skills.
